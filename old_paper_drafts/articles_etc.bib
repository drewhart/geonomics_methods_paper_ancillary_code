	abstract = {Urbanization significantly alters natural ecosystems and has accelerated globally. Urban wildlife populations are often highly fragmented by human infrastructure, and isolated populations may adapt in response to local urban pressures. However, relatively few studies have identified genomic signatures of adaptation in urban animals. We used a landscape genomics approach to examine signatures of selection in urban populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analyzed 154,770 SNPs identified from transcriptome data from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations, and used outlier tests to identify evidence of urban adaptation. We accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP dataset under an inferred demographic history as a null model for outlier analysis. We also tested whether candidate genes were associated with environmental variables related to urbanization. In total, we detected 381 outlier loci and after stringent filtering, identified and annotated 19 candidate loci. Many of the candidate genes were involved in metabolic processes, and have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Our results indicate that white-footed mice in NYC are adapting at the biomolecular level to local selective pressures in urban habitats. Annotation of outlier loci suggest selection is acting on metabolic pathways in urban populations, likely related to novel diets in cities that differ from diets in less disturbed areas.},

	abstract = {Tropical mountains are areas of high species richness and endemism. Two historical phenomena may have contributed to this: (1) fragmentation and isolation of habitats may have promoted the genetic differentiation of populations and increased the possibility of allopatric divergence and speciation, and; (2) the mountain areas may have allowed long-term population persistence during global climate fluctuations. These two phenomena have been studied using either species occurrence data or estimating species divergence times. However, only few studies have used intraspecific genetic data to analyse the mechanisms by which endemism may emerge at the microevolutionary scale. Here, we use landscape analysis of genomic SNP data sampled from two high-elevation plant species from an archipelago of tropical sky-islands (the Transmexican Volcanic Belt) to test for population genetic differentiation, synchronous demographic changes and habitat persistence. We show that genetic differentiation can be explained by the degree of glacial habitat connectivity among mountains, and that mountains have facilitated the persistence of populations throughout glacial/interglacial cycles. Our results support the ongoing role of tropical mountains as cradles for biodiversity by uncovering cryptic differentiation and limits to gene flow.},

Here, we employ single and multilocus analyses of genetic data (n = 116 231 SNPs) to describe signatures of ﬁne-scale adaptation within eight whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) populations across the local extent of the environmentally heterogeneous Lake Tahoe Basin, USA. We show that despite highly shared genetic variation (FST = 0.0069), there is strong evidence for adaptation to the rain shadow experienced across the eastern Sierra Nevada. Speciﬁcally, we build upon evidence from a common garden study and ﬁnd that allele frequencies of loci associated with four phenotypes (mean = 236 SNPs), 18 environmental variables (mean = 99 SNPs), and those detected through genetic differentiation (n = 110 SNPs) exhibit signiﬁcantly higher signals of selection (covariance of allele frequencies) than could be expected to arise, given the data. We also provide evidence that this covariance tracks environmental measures related to soil water availability through subtle allele frequency shifts across populations. Our results replicate empirical support for theoretical expectations of local adaptation for populations exhibiting strong gene ﬂow and high selective pressures and suggest that ongoing adaptation of many P. albicaulis populations within the Lake Tahoe Basin will not be constrained by the lack of genetic variation. Even so, some populations exhibit low levels of heritability for the traits presumed to be related to ﬁtness. These instances could be used to prioritize management to maintain adaptive potential. Overall, we suggest that established practices regarding whitebark pine conservation be maintained, with the additional context of ﬁne-scale adaptation.},

They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene ﬂow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efﬁcient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

	abstract = {The interactions between organisms and their environments can shape distributions of spatial genetic variation, resulting in patterns of isolation by environment (IBE) in which genetic and environmental distances are positively correlated, independent of geographic distance. IBE represents one of the most important patterns that results from the ways in which landscape heterogeneity inﬂuences gene ﬂow and population connectivity, but it has only recently been examined in studies of ecological and landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the study of IBE presents valuable opportunities to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in ecological processes, agents of selection and environmental variables contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New and increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems are poised to make signiﬁcant contributions to our understanding of the role of ecology in genetic divergence and of modes of differentiation both within and between species. Here, we describe the underlying ecological processes that can generate patterns of IBE, examine its implications for a wide variety of disciplines and outline several areas of future research that can answer pressing questions about the ecological basis of genetic diversity.},

To remove the effects of latitudinal variation in warming rates, we focus on seasonal changes in the mid-latitude band of the northern hemisphere between 27.5◦N and 40◦N, where the two major mountain systems are the Tibetan Plateau/Himalayas in Asia and the Rocky Mountains in the United States. Results from the multi-model ensemble indicate that warming rates in mountains will be enhanced relative to non-mountain regions at the same latitude, particularly during the cold season. The strongest correlations of enhanced warming with elevation are obtained for the daily minimum temperature during winter, with the largest increases found for the Tibetan Plateau/Himalayas. The model projections indicate that this occurs, in part, because of proportionally greater increases in downward longwave radiation at higher elevations in response to increases in water vapor. The mechanisms for enhanced increases in winter and spring maximum temperatures in the Rockies appear to be inﬂuenced more by increases in surface absorption of solar radiation owing to a reduced snow cover. Furthermore, the ampliﬁcation of warming with elevation is greater for a higher greenhouse gas emission scenario.},

	abstract = {Observations from the main mountain climate station network in the western United States (U.S.) suggest that higher elevations are warming faster than lower elevations. This has led to the assumption that elevation-dependent warming is prevalent throughout the region with impacts to water resources and ecosystem services. Here we critically evaluate this network’s temperature observations and show that extreme warming observed at higher elevations is the result of systematic artifacts and not climatic conditions. With artifacts removed, the network’s 1991–2012 minimum temperature trend decreases from +1.16°C decadeÀ1 to +0.106°C decadeÀ1 and is statistically indistinguishable from lower elevation trends. Moreover, longer-term widely used gridded climate products propagate the spurious temperature trend, thereby amplifying 1981–2012 western U.S. elevation-dependent warming by +217 to +562\%. In the context of a warming climate, this artiﬁcial ampliﬁcation of mountain climate trends has likely compromised our ability to accurately attribute climate change impacts across the mountainous western U.S.},

The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reﬂected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate–elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reﬂect the 1971–2000 period.},

	abstract = {A new technique for statistically downscaling climate model simulations of daily temperature and precipitation is introduced and demonstrated over the western United States. The localized constructed analogs (LOCA) method produces downscaled estimates suitable for hydrological simulations using a multiscale spatial matching scheme to pick appropriate analog days from observations. First, a pool of candidate observed analog days is chosen by matching the model ﬁeld to be downscaled to observed days over the region that is positively correlated with the point being downscaled, which leads to a natural independence of the downscaling results to the extent of the domain being downscaled. Then, the one candidate analog day that best matches in the local area around the grid cell being downscaled is the single analog day used there. Most grid cells are downscaled using only the single locally selected analog day, but locations whose neighboring cells identify a different analog day use a weighted combination of the center and adjacent analog days to reduce edge discontinuities. By contrast, existing constructed analog methods typically use a weighted average of the same 30 analog days for the entire domain. By greatly reducing this averaging, LOCA produces better estimates of extreme days, constructs a more realistic depiction of the spatial coherence of the downscaled ﬁeld, and reduces the problem of producing too many light-precipitation days. The LOCA method is more computationally expensive than existing constructed analog techniques, but it is still practical for downscaling numerous climate model simulations with limited computational resources.},

	abstract = {1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model’s predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},
