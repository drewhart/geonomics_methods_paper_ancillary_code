- could split validations tests into methods and results sections (rather than both parts of each test being together)
- explain why chose nuc diversity, why made so many parameter choices were made, why design and analytical decisions were made
TWO-TRAIT:
        - consider using separate colorschemes for each of the two traits in the two-trait test
        - could be opening a can of worms by even showing results of this (rather than just illustrating it could
          be done, by perhaps showing a diagram of a stack of rasters of diff env variables)
MOVE-SURF FIGURES:
        - put them side by side
        - make the landscape somewhat smaller
        - can highlight one cell and pop out to zoom into its distributions
        - make the backgrounds alpha = 0.5 
        - SECOND PLOT IS FLIPPED UP DOWN!
PCA TEST:
        - don't call it a PCA test! there's no testable hypoth
        - EITHER:
                - landscape with a movement barrier in the middle, and then one side with environmental diff
                        - to show both IBcostD and IBE
        - OR:
                - use a more realsitic (e.g. fractal) landscape
                

- report  

RUNTIME:
        - caption is all in the wrong order

YOSEMITE:
        - can't even see the rasters!
        - remove the individuals from the neighborhood-meaned raster
        - consider including pictures of just the backgrounds        
        - explain clear realistic A
        - just read in a directory of rasters instead
                - then I can get rid of the whole "we wrote some short scripts" junk, and actually highlight a cool
                  component of the package while simulataneously simplifying the explanation
        - put actual lat-lon values and actual temperature values instead
        - 0.) choose an actual species to simulate
        - 1.) download and load Cal-Adapt 
        - 2.) run SDMs to develop hab-suitability layers
        - 3.) point params file at those directories
        - 4.) plot real lat/lon and temp values
        - 5.) simulate
        

FIG 12:
        - add landscape, phenotype, and fitness cbars back in


- use different color palette across the whole packages
- build one or one pair of figures that provide a.) an image-driven explanation that lays out the whole function of the package,
and b.) a diagram of all components of of the model, 'cartoon style' 
- get rid of term "IBR"
- clarify how N_xy is being calculated and used in the density-dependence 
- add quick statement about how long it took to run each simulation (in the context of the discussion of each of the example simulations)
